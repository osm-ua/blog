One month ago, we called for Russians to resign voluntarily from OSMF working groups. None of them have done so yet. It is time for OSMF to do this - to deprive them of influence on the project by returning them to the category of ordinary participants. The Ukrainian OSM community considers the presence of citizens of the aggressor's country in the governing bodies of the project unacceptable. Their continued presence in the working groups nullifies the activities of all members of the global OSM community to build a free, secure and friendly world.[^1]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⛔️ All Russian residents as well as anyone who exhibits alliance towards the Russian Federation must volunteerly step down from all OSMF working groups. Otherwise, OSM Ukraine will treat them as those who are in the war against Ukraine. <a href="https://twitter.com/openstreetmap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@openstreetmap</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gischat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gischat</a></p>&mdash; OpenStreetMap UA (@osm_ua) <a href="https://twitter.com/osm_ua/status/1504429267765141511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
